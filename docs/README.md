# Project Documentation Repository

This repository contains the complete project documentation, organized into two main directories to clearly separate source files from the final, compiled documents.

---

## 1. The /output Directory (Reader-Ready Files)

This directory holds the compiled, final versions of all project documents in PDF, Markdown, and PPTX formats.

## 2. The /source Directory (Source Files)

This directory contains the source files used to generate the documentation. This includes files in DOCX, TeX (LaTeX).
